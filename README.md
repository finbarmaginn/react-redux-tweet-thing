# React Redux Experiment

This application started life out as a set of tutorials on youtube and from there i was able to expand on that knowledge to create this simple "Tweet Engine", you might call it, using React Redux etc etc. it is not isomorphic because i havent started following tutorials on that yet... see below for a link to the first of the video tutorials that I followed to get to where i am now.

## Serving Files locally

Because the application is not isomorphic i decided to use this simple tool to serve the files locally:

## Installing Dependencies

Making sure node is installed locally, navigate to this directory and run the following command in your terminal:

`npm i`

## Compiling Code

after having installed all of the dependencies and overcoming the errors that may appear in the previous process (i.e. making sure webpack is installed globally etc.) then run one of the following commands to compile the app.

### Compile for Development

`npm run dev`

### Compile for Production

`npm run prod`
